</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Thursday today, the day after the Day. It was a real long day, and to my surprise it said 'press' on my pass - so I had to try to ask some questions :)</p>
<p>Some things picked up:</p>
<p><strong>* New <a href="http://www.brocade.com/products/all/switches/product-details/vdx-8770-switch/index.page" title="on brocade.com">VDX 8770 product released</a></strong> - a modular Ethernet switch. Room for 384 10GbE ports. 100GbE ready and also ready for SDN protocols like <a href="http://www.vmware.com/solutions/datacenter/vxlan.html" title="on vmware.com">VXLAN</a> (vmware) and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj134174.aspx" title="on microsoft.com">NVGRE</a> (windows 2012). The VDX 8770 chassi is called "Mercury" internally in Brocade. I found it very similar to the DCX chassis  except that the supervisor modules are half-height.</p>
<p>* Today Brocade <strong>opened up registrations</strong> for the <a href="http://community.brocade.com/docs/DOC-2814" title="it's free!">BCEFP certification</a> - Brocade Certified Ethernet Fabric Professional (which include the VDX8770), It looks advanced and you probably want to take the previous exam - <a href="http://www.brocade.com/education/certification-accreditation/certified-ethernet-fabric-engineer/index.page" title="on brocade.com">BCEFE</a> - before.</p>
<p>* SDN - <strong>storage-defined network was the main focus of the day</strong>. Fibre Channel was barely mentioned at all. <a href="http://www.brocade.com/company/about-brocade/executive-profiles.page" title="on brocade.com">Ken Cheng</a>'s (one of the VPs of Brocade) definition of SDN:</p>
<h3 id="a-set-of-technologies-which-are-focused-on-achieving-three-objectives-network-virtualization-vxlan-programmatic-control-openflow-and-cloud-orchestration-openstack"><em>"A set of technologies which are focused on achieving three objectives: network virtualization (vxlan), programmatic control (openflow) and cloud orchestration (openstack)."</em></h3>
<p>It was quite obvious that Brocade's VCS is the technique/medium which they intend to enable these new technologies. SDN is still quite immature (even though internet2 are already using it in their production network) - so be prepared to wait if you want ready solutions.</p>
<p>* <strong>VCS seems quite similar to QLogic's/Juniper's <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/datacenter/details/" title="link to juniper.net">QFabric</a></strong>. They had a hands-on lab where we could connect four smaller vdx switches and a vdx8770 (4-slot version). The switches had only had a unique ID set on them and their were end-devices (web-servers, web cams and a tablet) on different IP subnets on each switch. All I needed to do to connect switches (and devices) was to connect two switches via a fibre pair. Quite easy. Almost too easy to be true. This is something I really enjoy that's part of Fibre Channel. The technology has quite a few features, self-forming trunks being one of them (with frames being striped over all members of a trunk). It also gets rid of spanning tree (so no more unused links).</p>
<p>* Quite <strong>soon we should see Brocade's OEMs release embedded VDX switches</strong> for their blade chassis. No news yet about which but lately IBM have been quick to release new Brocade products. As a side note: Brocade from start only sold their gear through OEMs, this is no longer always the case and they are trying to communicate more directly with customers.</p>
<p>* Cost per bit was really important to push down for internet exchanges.</p>
<p>* It's a lot easier to write a blog post on my wordpress blog via Chrome (on android) than via the native browser. Using my asus transformer tf101 as a note taking device for the day worked out great. Success!</p>                </article>
