</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a href="vimeo.com/19738092‎" title="on thepoprockindieblog">Young the Giant - My Body</a> # I like the first comment on the youtube - "When i heard this﻿ song for the first time i automatically loved it. Not very many songs can do that.". What I didn't like was was written on the blog where I found the song:  "﻿That's a pretty amazing endorsement from a man that most of us view as a God.". Morrissey? God? Drug-addict. Crap. Saw him in Marlay Park in Dublin some years ago and it was just pure crap. Good thing that <a href="http://www.themagicnumbers.net/" title=".net">The Magic Numbers</a> were on after :) Best ever! Haven't heard about em you say? Check em out.</p>
<p>(Actually double-checked in my old resdagboken.se so I didn't write false words). I wrote that me and Oskar were going to the consert, and I ended with the Morrissey is cool. So a bit of reverse of onion there, good, turns out I'm improving after all.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Another good song there: <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxEPKvVwyJM" title="heartbeats">Heartbeats</a>. Ever heard the Knife's or Jose Gonzalez's version? One of them was in a commercial. There is another cover on there now by a ﻿Ellie Goulding. For me it's hard to beat the Knife's version - as it's pretty awesome - and it has much more synth in it. Also Ellie's voice annoys me a little bit. Checked out some more songs, still annoying. There probably are more covers of the heartbeat song though, check em out!</p>
<p>Also - if you just found some good music - I'd love to hear! What are you listening to now?</p>                </article>
