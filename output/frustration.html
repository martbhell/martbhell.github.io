<p>Title: <strong>Is it just me? Or does everything required a fw update?</strong></p>
<p>Begins with some posts with some people never having any problems and some people who have had. Then gregersenj posted what I have pasted below, which is just a very honest and in my opinion accurate view of daily IT life. It may not be what others want to hear, maybe especially the people paying for the IT-services. But I believe nobody understands the <strong>whole</strong> picture in an IT-system. You may believe a lot but for everybody there are some areas that you don't understand <em>completely</em>. Like drivers, kernel, just as an example.</p>

A backup of the OA configuration is recommended, just in case.<div></div>Interconnect modules can be upgraded on-line. On-line FW upgrades neee a reboot to activate new FW. VCSU upgrade modules, then reboot them 1 by 1. Do you trust your enviroment? Do you want to take the risk?<div></div>Yes, the blade must be powered off to activate a profile. I don't know why, but I believe that the engineers have a good reason.<div></div>I will recommend you to create a FW anf Driver base line, and ensure, that you are allways within supportet release sets.<div></div>Most release notes do say upgrade at earliest convinience.<div></div>I learn new stuff every day, and the more I learn, the less knowledge I blieve that I have.<div></div>Theory is: It don't work, but we know why.
