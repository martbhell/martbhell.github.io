<p>OK, did the exam. Took 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>It felt like I was plowing through them pretty fast but after some 80-questions the speed dropped significantly and I started to have trouble focusing. Short unfocus/try to think about something else , stand up a bit helped. This test wasn't as nerve-wrecking for me as the BCFA - maybe it had something to do with that I didn't pay for this one.. (smålänningen i mig).</p>
<p>I realized last night that I hadn't listened to the BCFP nutshell guide (the one with audio) so I quickly went through that and I believe it helped a bit, even though it's for FOS 6.3 and 8G FC stuff. If you do this exam when it goes live, definitely do listen to the nutshell, maybe several times and don't forget to click the 'notes' button on the slides, there's more info there. It's kind of a very sped up/condensed version of the whole material, but there's some things that aren't even mentioned that you'll only find in the material. But it is free. It's nice to have somebody read it out loud, maybe they phrase it a little different than you do (in the head) that is just what's needed for you to understand it.</p>
<p>Also there are the simulations/labs in the material when you buy that's really valuable. For the BCFA they had virtual class rooms for this nutshell - looks like they might have changed this now and recorded it. One avenue less to ask questions.</p>
<p>Now the waiting begins. Two months until I get to know the results. Yikes!</p>
<p><strong>Gotta find something else to occupy myself with now.. hmm..</strong></p>
<p>Archiving? Buddhism? Apparently BCFD (fabric designer) is beta-tested in Dec/Jan. This would be the next logical step for me. Why not huh? =) Anybody has any ideas? Right now I just feel like getting myself into the next Malaz book by Ian C. Esslemont - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stonewielder-Malazan-Empire-Ian-Esslemont/dp/0593064445" title="on amazon">Stormwielder</a>, supposedly about Greymane!</p>
