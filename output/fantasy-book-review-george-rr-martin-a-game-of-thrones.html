<p>Warning, this article may contains spoilers (I am trying to be sublime about them though) and have written them in white text just to be on the safe side.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia these books are in these subgenres:</p>
<p>High Fantasy - lots of fantasy stuff going on - like magic and monster. Opposed to low fantasy that has less magical components and is set in familiar world. Dark Fantasy - a bit of horror</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>If you are reading the same book, check in the back for the family trees! Not any real clues that kills the book and comes in handy.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>000- Got the book in Academic Book shop near Aleksanderinkatu, Helsinki. 001- Haven't even read the prologue yet. Goes right into it though with a guy named Gared who's old 'n' sturdy. Will and some noble on a high horse travelling through a dark (and scary) forest. 002- Lots of introductions (short chapters with names of characters) in the beginning, primarily of young people - indicating that these probably will be people we will be following later on in the series. 003- I like this. Pretty fast paced now in the introductions, beginning of the story; it's not like the first book of LOTR. 004- Some animals / species or plants are real, as in they exist in our world too. For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs" title="aurochs">Aurochs</a>. One example I found is not the name of a tree 'here', but maybe they are taken from the name of a place - like the tree specie Weirwood. 005- Other animals are of course the dire wolves that are introduced to the reader very early in the book. There is a nice page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Wolf" title="dire wolf wikipedia">wikipedia</a> about them :) 006- People can die! Even "good" ones. At least that's what I hope. But I guess in all fairness it probably won't be malazan style but I will hope! 007- About half-way through now. Some characters are less introspective, or is that just how I feel it? Because they 'must' be hiding something? 008- Ahh, beautiful. I think I will most definitely be reading more. Good character building in this book. Not too much "boring" - I mean it did not feel like the first book in Lord of the Rings which was relatively devoid of action. This book is definitely not and doesn't feel like a classical 'first' book. For example lots of references are being made to the war when the current king Robert took the throne with the help of Ned/Edward. But not too much specific, it sure sounds like a lot of good action/stories happened 'back then'. 009- See 002- :) 010- Done with the book now! Man am I hooked! 011-  Deaths? Yes. Definitely deaths by high-profiled characters in the book. But not by 'surprise' as in the Malazan. Maybe I should stop comparing everything to the Malazan series..</p>
<h2>Ending Notes</h2>
<p>In terms of proportion action/politics I believe the book is in par with the Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan. Probably a bit more action. Now will this change? I sincerely hope so, good action is something I enjoy. As long as it's not too repetitive. Maybe it's easy for authors to get stuck in the 'same' kind of action - describing quite detailed how the actual swords play go. This I find boring. But every now and then it's nice - especially if there's something besides the-hero-wins happening.</p>
<p>Now the 'heroes'.</p>
<p>There's the usual 'we believe in the good and we are awesome' - represented by the Stark family. There's the 'Dr. Evil' crowd  - represented by the Lannister family. There are two outsider threads: Jon Snow and the Dragon siblings Dany and Visy.</p>
<p>Jon is 'good' but he is a hidden gem for the Starks. Maybe he will go his own way and pwn the Wall/north. Maybe he will come in handy later to fix the rest of the continent after the dragons/others come back. I hope both :)</p>
<p>Now as George R.R. Martin takes like 3 years between each book I will read something in between, then I'll get on to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clash_of_Kings" title="clash of kings - wikipedia">next in the serie</a>s.</p>
