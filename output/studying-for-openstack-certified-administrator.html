</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The plan : study a bit and then attempt the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/coa#coa-details">coa</a> exam. If I don't pass then attend the course during openstack summit: <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/summit-schedule/events/22735/rsvp-required-suse-two-day-training-openstack-administration-prepare-for-the-certified-exams-day-2﻿">SUSE</a></p>
<p>And what to study? I've been doing openstack admin work for the last year or two. So I have already done and used most services, except <strong>Swift</strong>. But there are some things that were only done once when each environment was setup. Also at $dayjob our code does a lot for us.</p>
<p>One such thing I noticed while looking through <a href="https://github.com/AJNOURI/COA/wiki/02.-Compute:-Nova">https://github.com/AJNOURI/COA/wiki/02.-Compute:-Nova</a></p>
<p>Was setting the default project quota. I wonder if that's a cli/webui/API call or service config. But a config file would be weird, unless it's in Keystone. <em>Turns out default quotas are in each of the services' config files. It's also possible to set a default quota with for example the nova command.</em></p>
<p>Another perhaps useful thing I did was to go through the release notes for the services. $dayjob run <a href="https://releases.openstack.org/newton/index.html">Newton</a> so I started with the release after that and tried to grok and look for biggest changes. Introduction of placement was one of them and I got an introduction to that while playing with devstack and "failed to create resource provider devstack" error. After looking through logs I saw a "409 conflict" HTTP error or placement was complaining that the resource already existed. So somehow during setup it was created but in the wrong way? I deleted it and restarted nova and it got created automatically and after that nova started acting a lot better :)</p>
