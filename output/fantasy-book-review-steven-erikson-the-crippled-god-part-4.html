<p>There is actually quite a lot going on about the First Shore. The malazans found the kids, they're running out of water. How are they going to cross this thing? It needs to be magical! There the Tiste comes back (Nimander). The queen goes crazy. But as with the High Mage of Shadow (where is he by the way? Still in Darujistan?) there are some lucid comments that tell quite a bit. Where is Silchas Ruin going? Well we have the Draconus and then the Kilmandros stuff, maybe he's going there for a visit.</p>
<p>The battle is like a vinyl slowly turning into a majestic battle - soon getting out of proportions I wager. OK, we got dragons. We got some army slowly crossing the deadly desert. When are the gods entering? =)</p>
<p>Tehol for the King! Oh wait. Anyway, He's funny.</p>
<p>I immensely enjoy the short scenes in this book staring some of the notorious characters from previous books but those that don't have a major part of the story (yet). I also enjoy that there's no need to describe who they are. I mean of course when they first are introduced you may not remember who they are until they've been around for a while, and maybe still you don't but at least the name rings a bell right?</p>
<p>I'm already at 70% and this is now chapter 22. Is this book not going to be 24 chapters?? My world is shattering!</p>
<p>*** Reached the end:</p>
<p>Turned out that there was indeed 24 chapters + two epilogues including the world's longest poem. I like that the God wrote a book. I'm not so sure I liked the few random happy endings at the end of the book. But it sure didn't go through all of the characters which leaves lots of openings for more stories afterwards.</p>
<p>Now I can finally put this series to rest :)</p>
