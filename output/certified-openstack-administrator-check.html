<p><img alt="" src="images/Screenshot_20181117-211026-512x1024.png"></p>
<p>Thought because it's done online it can be scheduled almost on demand, but one had to wait at least 24h for the exam environment to get provisioned.</p>
<p>The online proctor part was a first for me. For sure it'll help if you have a non cheap webcam (with a longer wire) that can be moved around.</p>
<p>The results arrived after only a day, 96% so I missed something small somewhere. Maybe about swift if I have to guess :)</p>
<p>I always liked these practical exams. One really need some experience with what is being tested. I don't thinn it is possible to just study. Fortunately it's easy to install a lab environment!</p>
