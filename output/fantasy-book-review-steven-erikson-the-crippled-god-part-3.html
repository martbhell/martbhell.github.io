<p><a href="http://www.guldmyr.com/blog/fantasy-book-review-%E2%80%93-steven-erikson-%E2%80%93-the-crippled-god-%E2%80%93-part-2/" title="part2">Part 2</a> <a href="http://www.guldmyr.com/blog/fantasy-book-review-steven-erikson-the-crippled-god-part-1/" title="part1">Part 1</a> I think this book is easier to read than the previous ones. For some reason I kind of like all the thinking, pondering and analyzing that the characters do. They grow on you? I wonder if it's just the book or maybe the Kindle assists me in reading;  I've been reading quite swiftly (in comparison to how fast I read one of the previous Malazan 'real' books).</p>
<p>Of course after 33% there's a lot of stuff about the bonehunters. They're walking through the Glass Desert. Hellian is sober and thinks they're going to Y'Ghatan. They're not.</p>
<p>Fiddler is quite depressing, most of them are but there's a good amount of stubborn exceptions that cling on to life like super glue. Urb for example, the under dog. I hope he gets her.</p>
<p>Mappo starts walking through the desert, he meets a D'Ivers (all the butter flies that the Snake met explained) and he is saved by Badalle. Maybe Mappo will find his meaning when he meets these kids. First I thought maybe the kids would meet with the Bonehunters, maybe they still will. But supposedly Mappo is going to find Icarium. But where is he? It's a bit disorienting - people are going along/across the desert but there's not any good maps (there is even a world map online if you search for it).</p>
<p>*Update - Aha - it is the Bonehunters who meet the kids first (or at least that's how I interpreted  the end of the last chapter I read).</p>
<p>The Shake's fighting down at the breach is also a pretty cool part. Quite a few times in the books there have been a small amount of people holding off another force trying to get through a small opening. This sword-type Husk - there hasn't been much about these in the previous books now has there? Take your average fantasy book and then there's this type of sword that slices through dragons like butter - how often would that be a pretty major chunk of the story? Like how the fabled Heroes go battle some Mountain Troll and get the sword back to it's rightful heir? About all of them. Not in this book though! Here the wielder finds it on the b(r)each where the big fight will be :)</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>One personal reason why I'm writing these review posts as I read the book is because my memory sucks and I don't feel like rereading the series again sometime soon :) 10000 pages is a lot.</p>
<p>Artwork</p>
<p>There's some pretty awesome artwork for the Malazan books on <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;global=1&amp;q=malazan#/d2tkmjo" title="on deviantart">deviantart</a> - do check them out!</p>
<h2>Kindle</h2>
<p>Two more things that are awesome about the kindle: a) it is better in direct sunlight than in the shadow and b) there's a built-in dictionary that works even offline.</p>
