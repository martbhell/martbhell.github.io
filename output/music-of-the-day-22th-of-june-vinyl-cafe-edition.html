      <p>My favorite English language radio-show is the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/" title="cbc.ca">Vinyl Café</a> with Stuart McLean. It's a CBC radio show and the hosts travel around Canada (and now also US) having live shows, live music, stories sent in by listeners and also their own stories of course. I guess you could say it's a show with stories, often fun ones.</p>
<p>I first stumbled onto it when sitting on the bus from Vancouver to Calgary, in the middle of the night I woke up in a <a href="http://www.wildlifeandroads.org/media/images/gallery/kgunson_banff_wolverineover.jpg" title="link to an image">valley near Banff</a>. I was on my way across Canada by myself. It was one of the shows when the crew travels across Canada on the train - where they have live shows on the train but also speaking with people on the train, asking for their stories. Reflection about traveling, stuff like that. Of course I was caught and have been listening to almost every week's podcast since then (summer 2008). Apparently there are many other shows but</p>
<p>The music they play is most of the time by independent musicians (monetary reasons I believe) so what you here are often eeexcellent live music. More often the music is singer songwriter style (one person) but sometimes a little band comes on the show and gives a great performance.</p>
<p>When I get to plan a visit to Canada I will try to go see one of these live shows :)</p>
<p>Today I'm listening to the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/shows.php?vShowID=1505" title="le show">4th June episode</a></p>
<p>﻿Luke Doucet and <a href="http://www.melissamcclelland.com/" title=".com">Melissa McLelland</a> sang some duets. Just pure beautiful.</p>
