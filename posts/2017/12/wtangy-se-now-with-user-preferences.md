As part of my learning some more about modern web developments I've learnt that cookies now suck and one should use some kind of local storage in the web browser. One of them is [Web Storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp)Â .

[https://wtangy.se/](https://wtangy.se/) got some more updates over the weekend :)

Now if you choose a team in the [/menu](https://wtangy.se/menu) and later (from the same browser) visits [https://wtangy.se/](https://wtangy.se/) you'll get the results for that team. The selection can be cleared in bottom of the menu.
