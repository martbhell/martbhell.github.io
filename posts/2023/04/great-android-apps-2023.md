## In 2023

My phone is a Samsung and I no longer have a tablet like in [2013](https://guldmyr.com/great-android-apps).

- flashlight is built-in
- I just use goodreads - not scanning any books :)
- and mostly use stuff from the browser
- the local public transport company app [HSL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.hsl.app) is pretty good
- i don't calculate
- but I use pushbullet!
- default launcher and no task killer in use, but I think that's because the one inside android is pretty good now no?
