My phone is a Samsung and I no longer have a tablet like in [2013](https://guldmyr.com/great-android-apps).

To compare, in 2013 I liked:
 - a flashlight
 - mybookdroid
 - goodreads
 - andropas
 - realcalc
 - irssi stuff
 - some different launcher
 - a task killer..


In 2023:
 - flashlight is built-in
 - I just use goodreads - not scanning any books :)
 - and mostly use stuff from the browser
 - the local public transport company app [HSL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.hsl.app) is pretty good
 - i don't calculate
 - but I use pushbullet!
 - default launcher and no task killer in use, but I think that's because the one inside android is pretty good now no?


Anything else great?

 - [Guitartuna](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovelin.guitartuna) for tuning guitar/bass/ukulele
 - [Simple ABP Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mdmt.sabp.free) really good audio book player
 - [inoreader](https://inoreader.com/) For that RSS juice
 - spotify 
 - google keep
 - all kinds of chat stuff like keybase.io
 - vivino/untappd
 - ankdroid (supposedly good for training / vocabulary, but I never had the patience for it to do it consistently)
 - fdroid&[termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) so nice to have a good terminal in the phone sometimes
