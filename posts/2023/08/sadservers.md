Have been trying these web based Linux servers challenges out for a little
while. seems to be a young service. They have a Linux World Cup coming up soon.
Today is the last day to [register](https://linuxworldcup.com/)!

After participating in CTF these challenges were not so hard but interesting
with new scenarios! Wonder how this stays afloat as it's currently free. Maybe
it uses containers a lot :)
