Spoke a bit with some people in the Brocade stand at HP Discover in Barcelona. The open source / core <http://www.vyatta.org/download> will be kept, but could not get any commitment to what will happen to it or if they will update it. The [5400](http://www.brocade.com/products/all/network-functions-virtualization/product-details/5400-vrouter/index.page "on brocade.com") (VSE, 6.6) and [5600](http://www.brocade.com/products/all/network-functions-virtualization/product-details/5600-vrouter/index.page "on brocade.com") (VR, 7.x) are however available for a free 60-day trial. With the 5600 having a new architecture and is interfacing more closely with the hardware (using Intel's DPDK to for example dedicate processes to cores) that improves performance "quite a bit".

// Update, I since found out about VyOS:Â <http://vyos.net/wiki/Main\_Page> which is a community fork of the Vyatta Core OS
