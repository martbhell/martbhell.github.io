This week in the [SDN course](https://www.coursera.org/course/sdn) on coursera there were lots of examples of real use of SDN stuff, for example like the B4 WAN by Google. They got a really _interesting_ and _cool_ interview with the Network Lead at Google - Amin Vahdat. And! They actually put this [interview up on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6YevjRFQ0 "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6YevjRFQ0") so you don't have to be registered for the course on coursera to view the interview. Actually I just noticed all the interviews are there, including the one I mentioned before with the Internetz Architect David Clark.

Programming assignment for this week is to work with [pyresonance](https://github.com/tamannajindal/pyresonance), which is based on [resonance](http://resonance.noise.gatech.edu/ "http://resonance.noise.gatech.edu/") + [pyretic](http://www.frenetic-lang.org/pyretic/) which is a controller that can change how network is forwarded/routed based on outside things, like network intrusion or bandwidth caps. This is really new stuff. The code that was put on [github](https://github.com/Resonance-SDN/pyresonance/wiki "wiki on the github, some more info") was put there just 3 days ago :)

Assignment is to create a load balancer and forward traffic to hosts depending on load :)
