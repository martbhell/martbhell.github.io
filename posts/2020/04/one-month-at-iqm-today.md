Was reminded that today was exactly one calendar month since I joined IQM Finland

It's been a very hectic month and it's been mostly remote because of the pandemic. Have met a few people, video chatted with a few. We have these weekly lunch meetings that is a good way to see and hear people . I try to bring up a little bit social non work things in the video meetings just to get to know people a little bit.

I'm really enjoying it and it's been interesting to see how the company mindset makes such a difference to my work as a sysadmin/it specialist.
