9 years were significant and meaningful to me.

We did a lot of cool things that as a very nice side benefit helped research, both in Finland and in other places!

I’ve been involved in some core projects, both for internal users and external ones. I was free to release code as open source. I have solved hard problems, gotten rid of manual work with automation and helped people grow.

I’m happy to have met great friends and colleagues at [CSCfi](https://twitter.com/CSCfi). I’ve learned so much and many thanks for showing how to work right and that it's not all about 9-5 work.

It has been a rewarding experience. I like to think I've come quite some way from where I started. So long, @CSCfi, and thanks for (all the fish) lasting memories!
