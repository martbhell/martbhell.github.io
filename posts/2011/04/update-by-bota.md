They're in Ontario :) Almost the same trip I took in the summer of 2008. Not that you have much choice going east. Also I did not do it in a moving truck :p

A little update on their [blog](http://bo7a.org/home/node/21 "on bo7a.org").

Also a [google map is here](http://goo.gl/Re8Wd  "botamap"), I'm trying to keep it updated, a little hard to keep track during the weekend but we'll see :)
