[The Submarines - You, Me and the Bourgeouisie](﻿﻿http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/fm3BH5MkXn4/ "on t61") - Lovely swing, great song to start the day with. Found a review on the [Washington Examiner.](http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/2011/04/submarines-bring-high-energy-live-show-new-album-black-cat "review") Her voice sounds quite a bit like The Cardigan's - Nina Persson. Or maybe Hello Saferide. Just beautiful anyway. ... "here we are in the center of the first world".

[Glasgow - Julia and the Doogans](http://juliaandthedoogans.bandcamp.com/ "on bandcamp") - check em out on bandcamp. Soft and sweet.
