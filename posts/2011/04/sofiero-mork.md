Ahh.

Beer.

I'm not a connoisseur when it comes to beer, I just usually like it :)

Has some more discussions. Apparently it hasn't arrived in Sweden yet? Not according to my sources in Växjö anyway - or maybe they are a little slow over there.

Sofiero brings nice memories from when I lived in Sweden.

Happy Friday here.

Checking out Florence the Machine and Glasvegas on the tube!
