In a moment of frustration/impatience I posted on 'Brocade Certified' that it was still 3 weeks until the results are posted. Good boss of training Joe Cannata replied that I could e-mail him and get the results before. I did, and I passed! Most excellent and kind of them to do that! So nice to not have to wait the extra three weeks until it's entered/updated in the Pearson Vue system. What kind of name is that anyway? Pearson Vue? Latin? Turns out no.

VUE [stands for](http://www.pearsonvue.com/about/history/ "source"): Virtual University Enterprises Pearson [is](http://www.pearson.com/about-us/our-history/ "source2") just from somebody's name.

Maybe there's another meaning behind the name Pearson (besides son of pear).

Back to the subject, how nice was it to find out that I passed? The first few days / week after the exam I was really aching to find out. Then I pretty quickly forgot about it. It wasn't until maybe a month and a half later that I thought, cmooon why is this so slow! All in all it feels pretty awesome to have the certificate! It took a pretty heavy amount of studying. I think maybe now I got the courage to go for the [designer](http://www.brocade.com/education/certification-accreditation/certified-fabric-designer/index.page "on brocade.com") one as well!
