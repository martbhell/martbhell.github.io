Until now I've been just reading the material, when there's something unclear in the material I've looked it up in command reference guides, release notes, user guides or otherwise on the Intertubes.

This doesn't really prepare you for the format the exam is in. I mean the exam is in questions and the answers are multiple-choice one. Unless you actively do it while reading this doesn't put your brain in - answer-questions-mode(tm).

What I've done is make flash cards with the question on one side and the answer on the other side. You can put whatever you want of course, but for example ' what is the command to enable fcr ' or if you want something more theoretical how about ' what are the advantages with fcip compared to dark fibre extension' ? Or the negatives? I have no idea what the questions were when I did the BCFA (I was just so happy I passed) but I hope this will prepare me somewhat for what might come.
