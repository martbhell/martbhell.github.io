Ah, finally. That felt good.

Maybe Boston was a bit down but honesly, 6-1? A few shots from Boston that hit the posts but it didn't feel like they sent many really difficult towards Jimmy Howard.

Been a while since Red Wings won this - and especially nice to see the big names doing what they're supposed to be doing :)
