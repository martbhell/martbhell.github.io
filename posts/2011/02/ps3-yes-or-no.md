As I will soon be getting some income again, we thought this might be a good time to get a video game console.

We do like the look of PS3 (Gran Turismo 5, NHL, etc). A bit pricey though. And then there's also all this negative news I keep on seeing about what Sony are [doing](http://www.myce.com/news/sony-speaks-ps3-hackers-will-be-permanently-banned-from-psn-40255/ "sony bann ps3 hackers") to prevent the recent compromised "some kind of authoring/security key".

Should we still get it? Maybe they'll get cheaper now?

It would have been nice to use something similar to [XBMC](http://www.ps3-hacks.com/2010/05/15/its-xbmc-on-the-ps3/ "xbmc on ps3") that I had on my XBOX (some 7 years ago).

Other options would be a

Wii - bores me pretty quickly but it's an OK party machine, but personally I prefer talking to people at parties

and

XBOX360 (doesn't have [Gran Turismo 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_5 "gt5 wikipedia")).
