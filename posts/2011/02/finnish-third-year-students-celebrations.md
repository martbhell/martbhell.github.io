Walked through a peaceful and frosty Helsinki today, when we stumbled on the Boulevard we were showered in candy and various songs on the theme 'we are the best'!

Turns out this is a tradition, the to be graduates celebrate last school day in 'Gymnasium' the rest of the semester is just tests apparently :-)

In Sweden we did have less classes, more tests and projects but this varied depending on which programme we attended.

All in all, spirit-lifting with so many people dressing up, populating their whole class on the back of a lorry and often with a theme and cool words on cardboard.

Thank you Helsinki and all good luck in the next months!
