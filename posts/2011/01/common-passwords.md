So read in a [Swedish IDG]( http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.363794/50-populara-losenord---som-du-bor-undvika "idg_password") today about the most common passwords.

On number 4 we had [lifehack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack "lifehack") \- but I had never heard about this before, so checked out Wikipedia on this and apparently this is a quickly written script with the intent to simplify life by filtering for example a feed like for example e-mail or RSS!

Unfortunately I do not have a lifehack :/ But it would be nice to have one! Think I will try to set one up as a filter on my e-mail account - does this qualify?

p.s. also I doubt that this is #4 in Sweden - but IDG Sweden I suspect quite strongly just translate English news d.s.

p.s.2 Today's song:Â  [James Vincent McMorrow - If I had a Boat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2XPDP6KkkE "James Vincent McMorrow") d.s.2
