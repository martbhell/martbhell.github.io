[Part 1](https://www.guldmyr.com/book-review-the-hunters-trilogy-by-r-a-salvatore/ "PART 1")

As you may have figured out, I sincerely doubt I will ever read another R.A. Salvatore - unless somebody tells me it's worth it and points to another series/trilogy. Thus part 2 will contain the last time I mention this book except for the title: **It** _**is**_ in the process of being returned to the library.

# [Good Omens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens "good omens wiki") by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman

Ahhhh, funny. Very very English. In a little weird way it is actually good to know a little bit about the M25 and [M40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M40_motorway "M40 - London") outside London.. . Besides that just lean back and enjoy the ride! It's pretty "simple"(not if you count the twists) and explanatory which is nice for a non-English person.

In opposition to The Discworld series by T. Pratchett Good Omens is not so much fantasy as it's set on Earth with a crystallization of some religious functions. Maybe crystallization is not the best words, I'm trying to say that they are more visible. Anyway.

As of this I have not actually finished it yet but I have grand intentions to do so within the next couple of days. Primarily because I have gotten [a tip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons "dance with dragons / george rr marin") for a book to read!

And this from the same person who introduced me to Stephen Erikson and the Malazan Series.
