Whoa, EMC released a bunch of stuff last night :)

Updating this post as we go today :p

\*\*\*

http://finland.emc.com/ some kind of bicycle jump on in 5h and 45mins! Or 1330 UK Time, 1430 Central European, 1530 Finnish.

\*\*\*

damn I missed the jump! something else going on, a kid replacing a disk and watching the status on an ipad? after one of the guys wanted to hi-five the kid but he missed ;)

now 26 people inside a mini cooper :)

maybe i haven't missed it :p

Quite in depth :)
