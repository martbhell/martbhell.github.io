Tried a few near us so far.

The one on Korkeavuorenkatu was good but felt a bit shady. Primula was very nice
and it's a nice pub too. Best take away so far is Sopranos on Petersstreet very
small place so you can't eat there if you are more than two. But a very nice
atmosphere there, felt like an Italian place :-)
