Just been to the immigration arbetskraftsbyrå in Hakaniemi. The course I have found that's out in Espoo should be ok.
They may pay for it too as their requirement is 14-16 hours per week and at least four days per week!

They sort the classes in different categories. Mine was A1.3 which is apparently a good one for me(a beginner).

The test they were going to send out will hopefully come before that. Apparently lots of people who want to study
Finnish.

Also found some cumin(good for middle eastern and mexican dishes) in an Asian store!
