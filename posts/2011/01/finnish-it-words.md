I have composed a google
[spread sheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Auhr1TJmDtqedEpKZENRRUF4eWF0X2FRWG81TTFHckE&hl=en&output=html)
with the intention to create a vocabulary of English - Finnish IT words and terms.

If you want to make additions I can give you access to the spread sheet or just write a comment in this article :)

It's quite hard to think of IT words just like that from the scratch.
