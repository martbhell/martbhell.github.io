Heading out to IKEA now, need a bigger duvet, cover for that, under-chair-protection pads and of course some meatballs and mash :-)

Almost all our stuff are from IKEA but it's so handy and quite cheap. Hope we don't come home with too much other stuff like we sometimes do. What's nice here is that they have a free bus going every now and they - it takes a while to get out there.
