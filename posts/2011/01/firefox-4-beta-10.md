Just got the message to upgrade to Firefox 4 Beta 10 and as usual I don't notice any differences - but that's a good thing right?

[Release notes](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/4.0b10/releasenotes/ "ffoxreleasenotes")

With 8GB RAM I don't think this will apply so much to me either: "Improvements in memory usage"

My (two) plugins still work too

The ones I use are webmail notifier (gmail, hotmail and a [custom squirrelmail script](/blog/customized-webmail-notifier-script-for-squirrelmail "webmail script")) and adblock plus. Default theme. A cluttered work space is very annoying to me :)
