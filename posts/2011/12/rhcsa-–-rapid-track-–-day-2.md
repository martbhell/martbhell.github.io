I wrote in the preparation that there were no 'set up ftp/www service'. What do you think we did today in the course? Set up vsftpd and httpd :)

Ssh hardening, set up vnc server, configure firewall via gui, ntp setup. Stuff like that.

It's getting closer! I believe tomorrow will be even more challenging, if there's storage stuff and encryption. But, setting that up via the GUI are pretty easy. So we'll see!
