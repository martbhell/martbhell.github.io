Just did the exam. Not bad at all, I really enjoyed this hands-on exam.

Great way to test someone's skills, although I thought it would be harder. But maybe I got lucky with the tasks.

I believe this RHCSA Rapid Track (along with My Own Preparation (tm)) and learning how to work inside a terminal/console is enough.

Can't wait until next week to find out how it went!
