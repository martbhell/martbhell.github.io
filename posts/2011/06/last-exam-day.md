Ever been there **after** your last exam?

You've just started a new job and some time ahead into the job you need to take the plunge, make some big changes, upgrades, something you haven't done before or just something that has a big impact. Maybe it's the day you do some actual work.

Maybe it's like a Game 7 in Stanley Cup?

I like to think so. And I'm trying to prepare for it like that as well. Stay on your toes! As many contingency plans as possible :)

P.s. Extremely well played Bruins and I do not regret getting up at 3am this morning to watch the game. Also hats off to keeper Thomas.
