I am currently going for the BCFP - fabric professional - exam, but I did the BCFA 6 months ago so I'll re-read the material and of course there's the new stuff with FOS 7, new hardware, 16g, new ASIC that I should probably learn as well.

## Some new stuff

'fabric name' is a new feature. But this is also more usable in VF - which is not part of BCFA. Firmware upgrades are the same (phew). DCFM is now called Network Advisor and it also has IP/routing and MPLS functionality now. Of course the 16G blades (with the first 8 ports capable of handling 10GB FC) and the FC10-6 blades. D\_port diagnostics (set a port to this before joining it to a trunk, or use it to measure distance on a long distance link, is accurate up to 5m). IDLE/ARB fill words are no longer necessary to configure (except on 8G platforms and not on Condor3). Condor3 is the new ASIC for the 16G blades. New/larger/longer/better ICL between the new directors that use QSFP instead of the crap max 2m copper cable.

## Kindle

One thing that's great about the kindle is that you can put the Brocade material on it (even in PDF) - just change viewing mode to landscape/horizontal and it will look great. Two pages per slide. I still have material from my old so that one works. But the material that is given for free now has 0 access rights so it does not work on the Kindle.

The way I write my personal notes is: write them off from the brocade material in my own words.

1. I do this on google docs.
2. I then download it into .doc and then
3. e-mail it as an attachment to youraccount@free.kindle.com.
4. Then next time you hook up your kindle to wifi it will download the documents, converted to .azw.

What's important here is to not use lists, as the conversion from a google doc saved as word and then e-mailed to youraccount@free.kindle.com does not like lists, it only takes the first level in the list.

I instead used headers, lost of them.

This is also nice because you can put a TOC which is clickable on the kindle.

Also pictures work in this conversation.
