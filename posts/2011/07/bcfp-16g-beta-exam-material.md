After the announcement of the available material Fabric OS 7.0.0a has been released.

On the page [http://community.brocade.com/docs/DOC-2041](http://community.brocade.com/docs/DOC-2041 "on brocade.com") only the first revision of the 7.0 release notes is available.

The BCFA 16G beta course material is also [available](http://community.brocade.com/docs/DOC-2039 "BCFA 16g material"), probably a good idea to read up on both and do a little rehearsing.

The old attachments are these:

The newer versions are not available if you have a registered account on my.brocade.com without any product registered to it. I've e-mailed Brocade asking for more access. In the meantime some are available on for example HP.com - but the Brocade release notes are not available there. And the HP Release notes for 7.0.0a have the HP names of the products. On HP's site you can go to the [manuals](http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DocumentIndex.jsp?contentType=SupportManual&lang=en&cc=us&docIndexId=64179&taskId=101&prodTypeId=12169&prodSeriesId=3742041 "manuals") for the 8/40 to get some more documents.

- [FOS\_TrblShoot](http://bizsupport1.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02912108/c02912108.pdf "FOS troubleshooting and diag guide 7.0.0") (3 June 2011, the same)
- 7.x.x FOS\_CMD\_reference guide (not available)
- [7.x.x FOS Admin Guide](http://bizsupport2.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02912101/c02912101.pdf "on hp.com pdf") (3 June 2011, the same)
- 7.x.x AG Admin Guide (not available)
- [7.x.x. Fabric Watch Admin Guide](http://bizsupport2.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02912099/c02912099.pdf "FW pdf") (29 April 2011)
- Neither is FCIP admin guide available
- But the Network Advisor stuff is. (assume these are the same)
- [7.0.0 Message Reference](http://bizsupport2.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02912102/c02912102.pdf "Fabric OS Message Reference v7.0.0 (53-1002149-01, April 2011)") (this has the public error messages that you may see in errdump)

Actually it looks like the documents available are quite up to date. I guess the Admin Guides etc don't update that often anyway. There is however a [document](http://bizsupport1.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02912109/c02912109.pdf "Fabric OS Documentation Updates v7.0 (53-1002165-01, June 2011)") in the manuals link above that explains that there have been some changes to some of the Brocade Documents. This might be worth checking out.

The conclusion of this little exercise is that the material available is currently good enough (for me).
