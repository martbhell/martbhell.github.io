Right now I'm reading through the BCFA material and writing what I find useful in a google docs document - later I will take this and send to my Kindle - for some of that memorization :)

Think it's a good idea to refresh some of the BCFA stuff before tackling the BCFP material, it was about 6 months ago since I took the BCFA and there are of course the new 16G hardware that was available then.

If you're new to all this - do check out the FC 101 training by Brocade, Â it is pretty awesome and I think I'll listen/read it once or probably more before the exam. It's good to refresh the fundamentals.
