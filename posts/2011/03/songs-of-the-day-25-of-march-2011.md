Same story as last time: I am listening from the laptop speakers while working so not listening to the lyrics much. I put in 'open mic' or a special mood in thesixtyone and see what comes up! Great way to find new music :)

[Awake My Soul - Momford & Sons](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/2pwGECdS8PS/ "on thesixtyone") # sing/song writer. Needs to be listened to more, the lyrics. Relaxing song. Banjo here too? Or maybe mandolin or something like that :)

[El Capitan - The Steelwells](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/ZVXIJ1F3VW7/ "on thesixtyone") \# Beautiful. I laijk.

[Harold T. Wilkins - Fanfarlo](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/u9puzC7ONcA/ "on thesixtyone") # Again nice, believe this was on the list a couple of days ago.

Birthday Party (demo) - The Preachers # energetic and emotional(?, maybe not, but I can feel?) good voice on the singer

Me and You - Helga Knardal # soft sung

#### Places to Go - Leftover Cuties # classical comp, like 70s, 60s. Lovely

[Do the Whirlwind - Architecture in Helsinki](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXIzyquw-kc "on youtube") # bitop. full of win. Awesome videos. See also [The Owls Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQL9JaVl7ns "the owls go on youtube") and [Hold Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxFF8rcG-A "hold music on youtube") by the same band.

The Spring Standards - Queens of the Lot # a little .. jazzy maybe?

**Favorites:** El Capitan, Leftover Cuties, Architecture in Helsinki
