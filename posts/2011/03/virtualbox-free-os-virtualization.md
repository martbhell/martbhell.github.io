Had the opportunity to try out [virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "virtualbox") the other day on RHEL.

I really liked the part that the rpm that I downloaded was signed and I had to import the signature to be able to install the package! Feels safe. Install did not cause any other problems for me.

As far as the interface goes I like it a lot. Quite intuitive and worked fine for what I did with it (load a pre-made .vdi, boot, configure).

Not that different at all from VMWare Workstation. But I didn't do much at all with virtualbox except the initial setup of the VM.

It is also free!

Some cool stuff:

- [manage the VMs via php](http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/ "phpvirtualbox")
- updated about once a month
- Runs on windows/linux/osx/solaris
- you can convert vmware vms into virtualbox format or you can actually [import](http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-convert-vmware-image-to-virtualbox-image.html "convert") a vmware vm

Not so cool stuff:

- oracle -> means suddenly you may have to pay licenses for it ;s
