Graciously taken from listening to thesixtyone.com today. Some links go to the youtube some to thesixtyone.com Please note that I rarely listen to the actual text of the songs, just the music and the rhythm. Primarily because I do not listen to them from my head phones, my hearing is a bit shot and the speakers now are from the laptop and a bit low volume.

[My Mathematical Mind - Spoon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIu-9PbmRao "on youtube") # ok

[The \`59 Sound - The Gaslight Anthem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1lq40tR72Q "on the tube") \# This is nice! Good tempo.

[Quiet When Group - Boduf Songs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3t4fZs9Xg "on youtube") \# no impression

[All Those Pretty Lights - Andrew Belle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_qqIlcIqjw "on youtube") \# Annoying voice at a start, maybe it improves? No it did not really.

[Peacock Dance - The Smooth Maria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prDZTtj2UE0 "on youtube") # Improves later on in the song.

[A Letter To An Old Friend (in the key of E flat) - Two Bicycles](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/hiBBayhtXHR/ "Two Bicycles on the sixtyone") \# Slow, the occasional banjo? Good thing I'm not the author of Larson (who supposedly hates banjos ;). Xylophone too maybe? Is this a band or a one-man show? Quite nice anyway.

Adieu, adieu - The Pharmacy # Psychadelic?

[In Ruins - Fol Chen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-nOM44hNdY "on youtube") \# Smooth voice. Asiatic sounds, chinese/japanese that is. Quite refreshing.

[Memento Mori - Unmorph](http://www.thesixtyone.com/song/comments/list/ykz3nnCt9DH/#/song/comments/list/ykz3nnCt9DH/ "on thesixtyone") \# Ambient? I like this mix ;) Although I did not touch the settings. Not only ambient, also some parts I would definitely call industrial.

[Rain - Curious?](http://thesixtyone.com/s/stphCUkHLWA/ "on thesixtyone") \# More xylophones or at least some kind of bell instrument. Relaxing. No vocals. Does the song sound a little bit like rain drops hitting the bells? They do feel random occasionally but with a rhythm.

[Social Standing - Tatiana Kochkareva](http://www.thesixtyone.com/song/comments/list/DsF7dzMScHF/#/song/comments/list/DsF7dzMScHF/ "on thesixtyone") # Singer is Russian - studied Jazz. Is this song jazz though? I have no idea. For sure I will look this one up later and listen to the lyrics.

[Comfortable Haze](http://www.thesixtyone.com/song/comments/list/o57tJSVI8Dn/#/song/comments/list/o57tJSVI8Dn/ "on thesixtyone") \- The Day Life # Playful guitar scenes, especially in the end. A little sad voice.

**Favorites:** Two bicycles, Fol Chen, The Gaslight Anthem and Tatiana Kochkareva.
