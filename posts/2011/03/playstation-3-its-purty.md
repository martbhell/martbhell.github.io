Got one this weekend, together with Gran Turismo 5 and Little Big Planet (or something like that), we've only played GT 5 so far but it's pretty darn amazing! It's quite hard but we do win - complete the challenges in the beginner level at least ;)

Altogether quite expensive stuff, but we'll try to get the rest of the stuff from online after this. Just wanted to get the console itself somewhere close in case we need help with the console or something is broken.

Check this out. You install it on your Window/mac/linux, then inside the playstation you go to videos and find it in there. And then you can stream videos from your desktop/laptop/server! Be sure to check out the forums, you can get the latest build in there. Of course you can compile your own stuff from the svn but I do not know how to do that. That would be a good post on here though, I'll put it on the to-do list!

Anyway, as far as I could read there are limitations to the ps3mediaserver. Subtitles in .srt format may not work, does not read inside compressed archives and maybe not all formats work.
