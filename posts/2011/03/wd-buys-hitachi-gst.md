Hitachi GST has quite a few home-based disk products which do look interesting.

Hitachi GST's page is very slow at the moment (2011-03-07 22:06 EET) - it even stopped responding. Maybe that's because it's getting slashdotted (./ed) or digged or something like that :)

Ye reckon this will make the drives cheaper? Sure hope so. I would like to get a little more, only have 2x500GB in my desktop at the moment :/ But might also be nice to get an SSD disk, but then again I don't see why. I don't really have any performance problems..
