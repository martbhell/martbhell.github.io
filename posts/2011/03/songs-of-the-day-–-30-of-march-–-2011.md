[Juke Cartel - Save Me](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/a5WokfWSZ5f/ "on t61.com")\#
rock, much more so than the previous ones I've mentioned :)

[Angel Jonathan - Jahel](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/WDs5v7vStRj/ "on t61")\#
trancey! apparently a little Irish going on at 2:15 :)

[Strength of Strings - The Keys #](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/Xq0NCHT4Nqk/ "on t61")
popped up under mood 'partay'. Beginning should've been under 'mellow' for sure
:) But the song increases in happiness after the first verse or so. Nice
guitars.

[Power Version - HiFi Hustlers](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/901Hl4lYHk3/ "on t61") #
nice rhythm! now we're talking..  dance-reggae-electronica?

[Kill the Director - The Wombats](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/6IaHCp9PJB2/ "on t61") #
pump it up! From livepool, not sure if this is good or bad.

**Favorites:** nothing that tickled this time
