A bit quiet here. I'm quite busy at work and also studying for the BCFP. Currently wrapping up the end of 'going through the material and putting what I find interesting in a document so that I can print it and re-read it and make notes etc'.

One thing I found was a Top Talker feature called 'EE Monitors'. As far as I could tell this was the same as Top Talker in 'port mode' in opposed to 'Top Talkers' which was 'Top Talker' in fabric mode.

Brocade Embedded SAN switches are called B54xx like 5424 etc.

Some terminology:

Ingress Port - Traffic Entering a switch port (rx) Egress Port - Traffic Exiting a switch port (tx)
