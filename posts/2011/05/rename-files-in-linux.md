Hey!

This is an awesome little trick I just learnt about:

instead of doing

`mv file1.txt file1.txt.old`

you can do this

`mv file1.txt{,.old}`

and it will automagically add a .old at the end of the filename.

This is called a brace expansion:Â [http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect\_03\_04.html](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_04.html)
