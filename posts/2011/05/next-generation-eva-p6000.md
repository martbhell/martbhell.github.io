On theregister there was recently [a post](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/03/hp_fifth_gen_eva/ "on theregister") that maybe HP will announce the new EVA's in Vegas in June - the P6000.

I just opened a discussion on the ITRC forum, maybe we'll see some more posts there. I myself am hoping for some thinÂ provisioning or why not SAS backends instead of the quite notorious FC loops. How about native iSCSI or FCoE?

\*\*\* 2011-05-05 Update, HP has now officially announced [some information](http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110503c.html?mtxs=rss-corp-news  "on hp.com") about it. For example that it will have the SAS-backend! Whoop! No more loop problems :)

\*\*\* 2011-05-05 Another one! Now it came - Thin Provisioning! [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/hp\_p6000\_data/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/hp_p6000_data/ "on thereg")
