Hard to tell.. but if you see this pretty cool 6min movie:Â [http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1430](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1430)

you'll see that they mention a collider. This thing sends out lots of data from each collision.

I administrate a system that gets a little bit (very little) of that data so that the scientists can look at it and maybe find out what's going on :)
