Is it just me?

Whenever I have to restart something or do some actual maintenance on a server - that my heart starts pumping and I get really really nervous.

I've heard many times people say things like:

"pain is temporary, glory is forever" (quote from [a movie)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/ "starship troopers") when it comes to dealing with servers. Or "no pain, no gain".

Guess these are the kind of things that do improve with some experience.
