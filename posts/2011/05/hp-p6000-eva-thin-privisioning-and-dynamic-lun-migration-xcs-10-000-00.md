2011-07-12: Updated with new link to new HP ITRC forum.

Also it looks like VAAI is not implemented in this firmware.

Some more news!

With Google Translate: _"Under the new EVA was also the XCS software updated and is now more stable and effi ¤ competitive. IT IS now available for r the EVA4000/6000/8000 EVA4100/6100/8100 and the version of XCS tion 6240 and for r the EVA 4400/6400/8400 and EVA XCS version of the P6000 10.000.00 to availability, with new features such as thin Provisioning "and" Dynamic LUN migration "for r coming EVA x400 systems._ _In addition, the new EVA Command View v.9.4, which for r all generations of EVA systems can be used."_

The newsletter was in German - it mentions [Thin Provisioning](http://www.unitiv.com/it-solutions-blog/bid/62903/5-Ways-Thin-Provisioning-Saves-You-Money "5 good things about TP - on unitiv.com") and Dynamic LUN Migration ([a blog post about Tiering](<http://storageexpert.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/the-new-storage-services-catalog-employing-storage-auto-tiering-and-policies/> "by "storageexpert"")). Especially interesting I find that the x400 will also get this 10.000.00 firmware - which kind of makes sense as it's already on 09.534.000 (one more number?). I take this to mean that the architecture inside the P6000 Controllers are the same as in the EVA x400 -series (PowerPC etc.).

Sounds like a great move, as long as the new firmware is as stable as they claim. EVA x400 was for most of the time not stable until the 09534000 firmware was released, unless you were lucky/did not have that many disk shelves.

It will probably be called XCS 10000000 , not 10.000.00 as written in the newsletter above.
