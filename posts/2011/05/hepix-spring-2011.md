I'm heading to [Hepix](http://www.hepix.org/ "hepix.org") this whole week!

Looks like there's some really [interesting topics](http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=118192#20110502 "timetable") like:

Lustre, glustre, ipv6, stuff about the CERN it facilities, Scientific Linux report, cloud/grid virtualization, Oracle Linux.

I'll sure be doing a bit of blogging about what's going down.
