[Just Pretend - Hayley Sales](http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/reverb-blogpost.aspx?post=3fe61693-6d40-47c2-aa49-ee84becaa68f)
is soft and nice. I like the part when the bass is more pronounced with about 50s
left.

[Train Song - Felix Fables](www.thesixtyone.com/s/vCKljmw6g1B/ "latest update April 2011") -
Folk Frenzy? Doesn't sound very folky to me. Maybe the background tunes and
vocals are. Quite down to earth music anyway.

[The Way I am](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJOzdLwvTHA "youtube the song") -
[Ingrid Michaelson](https://twitter.com/#!/ingridmusic "on twitter") - Hearty
and warm. Valentines day music?

[Tea with Cinnamon - Katzenjammer](http://katzenjammer.com "norwegian??") - Now
this is folky. Fast paced jumpy and happy music. Great for grill party. Also
they are apparently Norwegian. They also have another song on t61 -
"[A Bar in Amsterdam](http://www.thesixtyone.com/#/s/Os10FyXu2Dp/ "on t61")".
Insane start. I love it. When the chorus kicks in, it sounds like lyrics of a
power metal song a l√° Iron Maiden. Great!

[La-La-Lush](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/Kgvu1eiXlUi/ "on t61") -
[Megan Elizabeth Heise](http://www.myspace.com/meganheise "on myspace") - Not
much web sites about this one, but I found it in the open mic section so that's
OK I guess :) Pretty nice actually!

[She's All About The Love](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/fze1pORcq7F/ "on t61") -
Annie McQueen - singer/songwriter. Folky.
