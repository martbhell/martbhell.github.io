I couldn't get it to work.

Eventually I installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS in a VM in Virtualbox and in there it worked.

However, resolution is only 800x600. So I found this page:

That told me to install some stuff and then install the Guest Addition stuff. After that and a reboot HP Vroom no longer worked. But resolution was fine! Grah. Then I just used the "Live CD" of Ubuntu instead, or the normal .iso but no need to install, just boot from it.
