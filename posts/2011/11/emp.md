Do you print pictures or keep all of them online? What about if you've written a lot of text on some obscure blog on the Intertubez. What if something happens and you can't retrieve it?

Maybe this is just because I just started reading a post-apocalypsian book where an EMP just got set off. And it's making me a bit paranoid.

But I think I need to go print some pictures to ease my mind :)
