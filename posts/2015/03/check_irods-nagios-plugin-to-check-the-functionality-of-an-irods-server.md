Part of my $dayjob as a sysadmin is to monitor all things.

Today I felt like checking if the users on our servers could use the local iRODS storage and thus `check_irods` was born!

It checks if it can:

1. put
2. list
3. get
4. remove

a temporary file.

Dependencies:

-  iRODS 3.2 with OS trusted authentication
- mktemp
