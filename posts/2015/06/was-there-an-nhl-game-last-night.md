Yesterday my Internet activities was restricted unnecessarily!

While waiting for the replay of last night's NHL game to air, I didn't want to browse quite a large chunk of my normal Internets - because knowing the score while watching the game sucks. Unbeknownst to me - there was no game last night! Queue impatience, etc.

**No more**! _(at least for the remainder of 2015 edition of the Stanley Cup)_.

Today (2015-06-07) it says YES, hopefully tomorrow (2015-06-08) it will say NO :) //update - it did!

This is my first trek into google cloudappengine thingy. Very much work in progress but it's enough for now.
