Update! If you view this blog on an a mobile device with the right user agent (and apparently very few of you do that)
there's now very little white space wasted! It's not perfect yet but I'm working on it making it nicer. It seems to have
some

Now about the normal Hemingway Ex theme, I like it. But there's a lot of unused white areas when on 1920x1080 (17% of
visitors - also the one I use ;)

So I tweaked the stylesheets to make some sections thinner and some wider. Don't like it? Please let me know in the
comment section below.

P.s. Developer Tools in web browser are full of awesome! Trying to find the right CSS section to edit would have been
mental without it. P.s2. Just to be clear, the Blog was not hostile towards mobile users before.
