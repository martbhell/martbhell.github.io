To register for the exam, head over to the post on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/21b740/brocade_giving_away_a_free_certification_brocade/ "http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/21b740/brocade_giving_away_a_free_certification_brocade/"). Basically there's a pdf with the voucher you use when registering for the exam on pearsonvue.

Currently the "CEF 250" is free, but it's not the main curriculum for the course.
