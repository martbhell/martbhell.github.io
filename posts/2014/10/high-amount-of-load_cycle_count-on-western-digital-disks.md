You are monitoring the SMART values of your disks right? They're usually a real
good indicator of the health of the drive.

Thought I'd check out the SMART value of the disks in my desktop today (while
checking if I had notifications from smartd on).

Low and behold, the Load_Cycle_Count (LLC) was really high, much higher than
power_cycle_count on the 3TB WD disk I have. It turns out this is quite an old
problem so there are a few posts about this on the Internets. The
Interwebs [says](http://www.storagereview.com/how_to_stop_excessive_load_cycles_on_the_western_digital_2tb_caviar_green_wd20ears_with_wdidle3%20)
max in the specs are 300k load cycles. Smartctl -a says I'm already at 218602
after 9302 power on hours (387 days but I power off the computer at night).

Disk:

Model Family: Western Digital Caviar Green (AF, SATA 6Gb/s) Device Model: WDC
WD30EZRX-00DC0B0

For Windows there's a wdidle3.exe that is a DOS program that one can put on a
bootable floppy (...) and boot a computer on to change some stuff on a disk.

Fortunately I run Linux (Ubuntu 14.10 since yesterday) and there's a tool called
**idl3ctl** - one can grab it from here:
[http://idle3-tools.sourceforge.net/](http://idle3-tools.sourceforge.net/ "http://idle3-tools.sourceforge.net/")

I got the latest source code and compiled it myself because there had been some
updates to it since the last release (2012 vs 2011 ..). "idl3ctl -g" shows that
the disk was set to park itself after 8s. I disabled that with idl3ctl and
powered off and on the computer and now the tool says it's disabled.

Hopefully this should increase the lifetime of my disk.
