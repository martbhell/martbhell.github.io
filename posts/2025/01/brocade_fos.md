Sometimes I get requests about where to download Brocade Fabric OS.

So just to be super clear. No I don't have any such firmware available and I don't know where to get them. Best of luck
out there!

I haven't used fibre channel for quite a long time at this point and frankly don't know if it's possible to get them
without paying for support.

At least it seems like there are still fibre channel being made, Brocade branded ones about
[6](https://www.broadcom.com/products/fibre-channel-networking/switches) are available.

From what I can tell one could:

- ask [Broadcom](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/267270/fos-fabric-os-downloads-and-documentatio.html)
  directly
- ask a vendor like
  [HPE](https://support.hpe.com/connect/s/product?language=en_US&kmpmoid=1009472119&tab=driversAndSoftware&cep=on) has
  downloads for 8.x and 9.x firmware but there one has to sign in.

> An active warranty or support agreement covering StoreFabric must be linked to your HPE Support Center profile to
> access this firmware.
