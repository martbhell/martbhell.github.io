## Witch

Just managed to beat Noita!

With a moderate amount of spoilers and wiki reading it took about 127 hours to
beat the Tutorial.

Got a teleport wand and a freezing field early on. Went to fungal caverns and
got wand with some green magic missiles that I could use to get out of some
hairy situation.

Perks: got invisibility after Jungle. That helped a lot :)

Also made progress and got some new perks I hadn't taken before: Iron Stomach.
Didn't use it for anything though.

## My usual Route

- both sides of the mines
- 2nd jump then go left to try to get a decent wand
- try not to get sniped in the snow
- usually hit right, been getting some broken wands in hiisi base
- jungle need a bit more damage dealing
- vault - okay tiny bit more
- temple - okay now the wand that was just enough in jungle is now inadequate
