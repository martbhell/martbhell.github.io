Just tried out the "[Red Hat Skills Assessment](http://www.redhat.com/training/assessment.html "redhat.com")" for RHCE.

These are apparently the ones I need to work on:

- Managing Simple Partitions and Filesystems Some Understanding
- Managing Flexible Storage with Logical Volumes Substantial Knowledge
- BASH Scripting and Tools Substantial Knowledge
- Manage System Resources Some Understanding
- Logical Volume Management Substantial Knowledge
- Centralized and Secure Storage Familiarity
- Web Server Additional Configuration Familiarity
- Basic SMTP Configuration Familiarity
- Caching-Only DNS Server Familiarity
- File Sharing with NFS Familiarity

But the assessment doesn't say which questions I missed, so it could be that some of the ones with "Deep Understanding" I could have gotten enough answers right by guessing. Best to not answer if you don't know so you get a better pointer at what to look at?
