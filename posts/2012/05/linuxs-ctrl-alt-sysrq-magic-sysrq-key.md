Wow, awesome.

Looks like you can do lots of fun stuff here in case you get a stalled system.

Quite fun that this is a quite useful thing and I have never heard of this
before. Maybe Linux community is being quiet about this because it's close to
ctrl-alt-del :)

mnemonic: **BRUISER** (REISUB)

unRaw (take control of keyboard back from X), tErminate (send SIGTERM to all
processes, allowing them to terminate gracefully), kIll (send SIGKILL to all
processes, forcing them to terminate immediately), Sync (flush data to disk),
Unmount (remount all filesystems read-only), reBoot.
