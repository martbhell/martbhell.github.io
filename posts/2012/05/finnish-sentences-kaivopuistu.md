Disclaimer: I am still studying Finnish and not so good :)

The posts that I'm trying to write here are just a way for me to practice writing Finnish.

Kaivopuisto on iso, vihreä ja meri vieressä. Sisällä ovat puut ja kukat.

Kaivopuisto is big, green and next to the sea. Inside are trees and flowers.

\-- Turned out this sentence was not the best finnish :) Puistossa and partitivi might be better to use!
