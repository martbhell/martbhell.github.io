CentOS 5.8 was released today 8th of March.

[http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS5.8](http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS5.8)

You can download it from many mirrors, for example from
FUNET: [http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/INSTALL/Centos/](http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/INSTALL/Centos/)

It installs just fine on an HP DL360 G7 with P410 and P411 controller.

CentOS has as far as I understand been slower at releasing updates than Scientific Linux (for example 6.2 was out 5 days
earlier on SLC than on CentOS), this was not the case today though, SLC 5.8 is not available yet. Why?
