## owncloud

[http://susestudio.com/a/TadMax/owncloud-in-a-box](http://susestudio.com/a/TadMax/owncloud-in-a-box "http://susestudio.com/a/TadMax/owncloud-in-a-box")

Based on opensuse 12.1, I tested this out in vmware workstation by downloading the vm version (has a .vmdk file) inside
the .tar inside the .tar.gz.

"Run the appliance, go to `http://[yourservername]/owncloud` and login as admin with the password owncloud42. Change the
password in the admin interface and use the URL, which is shown there to access ownCloud via WebDAV."

files, music, bookmarks, calendar, e-mail client, ldap and unix pam integration.

All in all, it looks like it could be quite cool. And it appears to be updated quite often too with a quite active
community. But this takes a bit of commitment. First you want to move your existing stuff into this one (so you want to
have backups of it etc) and you want to host it somewhere reliable (in case you access it through your phone etc). But I
can see the potential, is quite nice to not have to depend on google or your `other_random_cloud_vendor` for these kind
of services.
