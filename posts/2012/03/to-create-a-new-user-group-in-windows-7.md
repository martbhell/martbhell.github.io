May or may not be needed for the P6000 Simulator. It is however required when you install the real HP P6000 Command View.

First you need to get into 'Computer Management', do this by right-clicking on 'My Computer'. Then click your way into 'Local Users and Groups', and then into the 'Groups' section. In there, right-click somewhere and create a new group called 'HP Storage Admins' (or HP Storage Users for read-only). While creating it you can add a user (the one you log in with probably), you can also add it later by right-clicking the group.
