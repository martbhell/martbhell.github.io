Bicycling Is Fun!

- Bicycle up to and over a fog covered Golden Gate bridge, pretty awesome downhills!
- Eaten at a relative's french gourmet food (not expensive!) - it's name is: sous beurre. It is up on 24th mission street together with a cafe called sugarlump.
- Went to great coffee place called: Sightglass Coffee. Real, good coffee with flavour.
- Also went for breakfast at an awesome American breakfast by Chinese folks. Don't think I'll find it again though :) I may want to give it a try ;) It was Golden!
- Lots of walking around the hills, no car chases yet though.
- Many other conferences happen here, quite often it seems. For example Intel's IDF which was over yesterday and saleforce's cloud computing (next week).
