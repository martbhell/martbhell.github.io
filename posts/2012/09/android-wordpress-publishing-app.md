Enabled! Wonder if there's been lots of exploits for this method of writing posts?

Turns out there are lots of old exploits for wordpress and xmlrpc, apparently it may also leave the page open for bruteforce attacks.. I'll leave this one disabled.

But I bet there are other ways to upload posts. E-mail perhaps. But it's actually working pretty well with google chrome -- at least it's a lot smoother than the native android browser.
