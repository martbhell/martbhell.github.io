Checked in at the hotel, mighty fancy one, it has a pool :)

Weather is great down here, much warmer than in San Fran. Hotel is basically
right next door to where I'm heading tomorrow and it looks like there's quite a
lot of people coming!

Cisco is right next door to, gotta go snab some pictures while I'm here, may not
get any time off tomorrow.

Lots of lunch places next door too, I was afraid it was going to be in the
middle of an industrial area.

And a bonus picture has been taken, but I appear to be having some issues
inserting it into the post..
