### Data Collection

- Given a scenario, design a solution that meets the customer's requirements
- Given a scenario, demonstrate knowledge of resiliency, redundancy, HA, and locality
- Given a scenario, describe the various documents required in the design assessment

Practice by making up many scenarios and then deciding which is the best way to design it.

### Management and Monitoring Tools

- Given a scenario, describe how to satisfy a specific monitoring requirement
- Demonstrate knowledge of Brocade management tools

What to monitor How to monitor these

### Hardware/Software Products and Features

- Demonstrate knowledge of interoperability of B-Series/M-Series products
- Given a scenario, describe Brocade hardware products and their purpose
- Given a scenario, demonstrate knowledge of Brocade software features and purpose

Interopmodes Features: VF, FCR, TI, QoS, FW, IRL, Trunking, Port Fencing, D\_Port

### Distance Solutions

- Given availability, performance and distance requirements, design an appropriate long distance solution using Fibre Channel
- Given a specific set of requirements, demonstrate ability to design a SAN extension solution using FCIP

FastWrite, Tape Pipelining, SACK Max distance for LWL and ELWL: Max performance of FCIP:

### Performance Tuning Optimization

- Given a performance scenario, determine an appropriate solution
- Describe strategies for maximizing throughput in a Data Center Fabric

ICL, nohops, trunking. How to increase performance in FCIP and FCR:

### Migration and Integration

- Given an existing fabric, identify migration strategies to upgrade the fabric with new technology
- Given a set of existing fabrics and network devices, determine a consolidation plan that minimizes disruption
- Describe the requirements to integrate a Brocade DCX Backbone into an existing M-Series fabric

FCR, Integrated Routing, E\_port on a switch in the M\_series.

### Security

- Identify requirements for restricting which switches/devices may join a fabric
- Identify security features to restrict administrative access to a switch

SCC, AUTH DCC Distribute: RBAC IPFilter
