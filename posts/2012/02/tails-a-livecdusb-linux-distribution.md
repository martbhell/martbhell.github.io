It looks like it's been renamed to '[tails](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html "boum.org")'.

It is based on Debian, is a LiveCD and it's purpose is to preserve anonymity and privacy.

When you install it in a VM it gives a pop-up to [this link](https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/index.en.html "on boum.org") saying that running it in a VM may not be the safest option.

There's a few default plugins in iceweasel (looks like firefox, in fact it is a fork of firefox):

- adblock plus
- amnesia branding
- cookie monster
- firegpg
- foxyproxy standard
- greasemonkey
- https-everywhere
- monkeysphere
- noscript
- torbutton

It also starts with TOR configured and in 'private browsing' mode. There is also an I2P application/network that can be used. Both are however quite slow (but generally this shared type of proxy-ing usually is?) As in ~10 seconds to load a web page.

Easy to use, but still slow.

**Is performance is something worth losing to gain privacy and anonymity?**
