Just updated the theme toÂ [http://www.nullin.com/hemingwayex/](http://www.nullin.com/hemingwayex/)

and I must say I like it quite a lot :) Especially that two posts are available next to eachother. I think this theme will be better for people who have larger screens. At least the home page is better. But I'm still not sure if each individual post is looking better. There's a lot of white space on the left side of really long posts, like the quite important Brocade SAN Upgrades.

Don't like it? Please let me know!

Changed to this in the CSS - hard to see the links by default:

a{
	color:#FFF;
	text-decoration:underline;
}
