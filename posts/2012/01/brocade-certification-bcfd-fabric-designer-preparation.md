BCFD exam is going into Beta testing in January as well!

This post will be updated as I move along through the different objectives / documents.

// Update 2012-01-15: Added the Knowledge Assessment Test. // Update 2012-01-28: Went through each .pdf and updated some in here.

The link to the Brocade page where it tells you how to register and where to get the material: <http://community.brocade.com/docs/DOC-2379>

\# Note: This link no longer works

When are these available? On Thursday 12/01/2012 at 0728 EET it was not available. On Thursay 12/01/2012 at 0803 EET it was available.

So, that would indicate that the time Pearson follows is GMT-6 or Central Time.

On top of that the only available dates for me was 23rd and 24th of January :( Time to study! // update, that was changed, it was a mistake so now I get some more time to study :)

## Exam Study Resources (page numbers are document page numbers, NOT the PDF page)

As I see it, the importance of each document could be arranged like this:

1. CFD 200 Modules 3-7
2. SAN Design Best Practices
3. FOS Administrator's Guide
4. The rest.

With 1/2 sharing the top spot. I haven't gone through the modules yet but I presume they all complement each other. The reason for them sharing the top spot is because for this Beta Exam, the CFD200 material is for 8Gbps (and it has quite a lot of details about the M-series McData switches, which the 16Gbps BCFD did not include).

There is also a Knowledge Assessment on my.brocade.com 'education' page. It's called "CFD 201 8 Gbit/sec BCFD Knowledge Assessment". Again, this is for 8G so beware that some stuff may not be up to date if you are doing the Beta for BCFD 16G. But, the actual type of questions is something that is useful. It mentions EFCM or Fabric Manager some times (this is the previous names of DCFM or what's now called Brocade Network Advisor).

There is a nutshell guide for BCFD, but this is from November 2008 making it possibly even more outdated than the CFD200 material. But, because most of the topics are still valid it would still work as a refresher, but you can't use it for anything specific.

I am doubtful that the M-series will be included in the BCFD 16G exam but as it's still in the objectives for the 8G it's probably wise to not skip that part completely. For that 1.5 years (half 2009 and 2010) when I did SAN support I only had one call about a McData switch.
