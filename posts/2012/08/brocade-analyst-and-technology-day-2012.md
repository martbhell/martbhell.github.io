I've been invited by Brocade to their Brocade Analyst and Technology Day 2012!

It's in San José, California and it's going to be a blast to get over to the US again, it's been a while.

In anticipation of possible future blog posts I just want to let you know that I'm not getting paid for this - Brocade are paying for flights/hotel though.

More details about the day can be found [on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/467575053272733/ "Brocade Analyst and Technology Day") and there's an agenda [here](http://bit.ly/MhwDEw. "agenda").

It's also possible to register and view the event via the Internets. Will it be broadcasted on this URL perhaps? http://brocadeanalystday2012.com/ Strange page, just empty with a sky background.

With talks from [soon-to-be](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/17/brocade_klayko_to_go/ "on el reg") ex-CEO ([new CEO being announced?](http://money.msn.com/top-stocks/post.aspx?post=f38b5073-95a8-4909-bf93-fa9c01a1b42a "on msn.com ...")) and veep of Data Center Networking Group Jason Nolet about new innovations for fabrics it looks interesting indeed.

 

Time to suit up :)
