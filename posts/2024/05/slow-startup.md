## Slow Startup

Does this happen on your computer?

- After starting start menu / task bar might become unresponsive
- After opening browser it takes a while (lots of seconds) before pages starts to load

## Try these things

- It is often/always DNS. Is one of the DNS server your computer is set to use perhaps
  no longer working? That'd sure make things slower.
- Except when it's not. Is your computer setup to use a proxy server?
  For me unticking the "automatically detect proxy settings" did the trick.
  I'm using a [setup script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_PAC_file).
