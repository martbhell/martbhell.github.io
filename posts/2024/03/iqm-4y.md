It's hard to believe that it's already been four years since I first joined the team at IQM,
completely new to the exciting world of Quantum Computing.

It's been an incredible journey filled with learning, challenges, and a sense of accomplishment.

## Starting Fresh, Building Confidence

The supportive environment at IQM provided numerous opportunities to explore and grow.
I actively participated in various projects, including:

- Testing the Control Software Installation:
  While my initial attempt wasn't the final solution, it served as a valuable learning experience,
  establishing a crucial safety net and reducing stress for the team moving forward.
- Promoting Infrastructure as Code:
  As part of the IT operations team, I championed the importance of Infrastructure as Code
  and achieving reproducibility in our processes.
- Advocating for Ease of Installation:
  Contributing to the Software Development team, I emphasized the need for user-friendly and
  easy-to-install software solutions, improving overall user experience.

## Overcoming Challenges, Discovering Impact

Every journey has its hurdles. Balancing the need for immediate solutions with long-term viability
was a key lesson learned.
It's about finding the right balance between addressing present issues and ensuring future sustainability.

The decision to explore Prometheus, made in [a previous blog post](./3-months-at-iqm-today),
continues to have a positive impact on our monitoring capabilities.

This highlights the collaborative nature of our work, where ideas can originate from various sources
and benefit the entire team.

## Lessons Learned, A Look Forward

Today, I'm proud to say that I've started to understand the basics of Quantum Computing, its components,
and the intricate processes involved in maintaining a Quantum Computer.
More importantly, I've learned the value of collaboration and how to think strategically about future
implications of my actions.

I am deeply grateful to the supportive team at IQM who made this journey so enriching.
Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the success of IQM in the
ever-evolving field of Quantum Computing.
