## 0.31 Tournament

These are my
[stats](https://crawl.develz.org/tournament/0.31/players/martbhell.html). I have
not finished the game many times. It is hard. I think the original idea was by
someone that played nethack and thought it was too easy.

**Everything wants to kill you!**

I usually play MiBe (mostly because I really want to hit berserk if I'm in a
tight spot).

Feels like Minotaur Berserker is more difficult this time around..

My current usual route:

- Dungeon levels until 10 or 11
- Lair of Beasts
- Dungeon level 12
- Orcish Mines
- Dungeon levels 13-15
- First Lair Rune Branch
- Second Lair Rune Branch
- Vaults levels 1-4
- Elven Halls (optional)
- Depths
- **Do not Go to say the Crypt or some Pandemonium to try to "get some more exp
  before 3rd rune"**
- 3rd Rune (Abyss, Slime or Vault 5)
- Zot 1-5
