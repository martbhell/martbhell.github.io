The other week I finally for this thing working I've been trying weakly to do
every now and then when I had a few minutes free: send an alert before a toner
runs out in a printer!

Way back I set up [SNMP_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter)
to fetch metrics from switches. This worked very nicely. ( In retrospect this
works nicely because it's the default type of device )

But for printers we didn't get much useful data out. Even though we use the
vanilla upstream
[snmp.yml](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/blob/main/snmp.yml) which
has printer stuff in it. And when I did an snmpwalk I did manage with some
research to find the correct OIDs to query to get the level of ink in the
toners. So I knew the printer did publish the information I was looking for.

The answer? Select a **module** when sending the request to the exporter! I
didn't select **printer_mib** so it used if_mib that only has interface
statistics.

What would have helped? Not suing the vanilla (large) snmp.yml and only use a
custom one that has the data we wanted..

Printers are no fun :/

Prometheus is!
