[Dog Days Are Over - Florence and the Machine](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/5X6CJmbA6qc/ "on t61") - Just awesome.

﻿ [Satellite - Leila Boussard](http://www.thesixtyone.com/s/RPWq7yY9bMj/ "on t61") - Also quite nice. But not as nice as ^^

Happy Tuesday :)

Saw the 3rd game in the Detroit - Phoenix Stanley Cup series this morning.

Lovely to see Helm fight like a bull and the Mule got in a nice kicker in the top shelf with that goal of his.
