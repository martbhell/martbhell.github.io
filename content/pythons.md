Ever thought about studying a bit of programming? Thought it was a too daunting task?

I've just gone through the second lesson on [learnstreet](http://www.learnstreet.com/ ".com") and it's quite fun! It doesn't take long to go through the first two lessons, so if you don't have much time you can spend a few minutes each day going to the next exercise or lesson.

Only other language I've studied is C++ back in high school - it did not sit so well with me back then.

Since then I've made acquaintance with [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), Python and Perl, but never made it too far away from bash.

Why start with Python then? I've seen announcements of vulnerabilities for Ruby [lately](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/), Perl isn't on learnstreet and Python is used in some scripts at work.
