Even though I'm on summer holiday I'd squeeze in time for a [Software-Defined Networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking "on wikipedia") course on coursera! [https://www.coursera.org/course/sdn](https://www.coursera.org/course/sdn)

It's given by a professor from Georgia University.

It's still not too late to register, it's only on the second week (until tomorrow Monday 8/7) and the first two weeks are not too complicated, just some introductions and history for SDN. Programming things should start soon though. The hard deadlines for each week's quiz aren't until 5th of August so plenty of time to catch up.

In particular I'd recommend a quite cool interview with [David D. Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Clark "on wikipedia") and who is that? Quote from wikipedia: _"... acted as chief protocol architect in the development of the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet")..."_ Which is pretty awesome. Hearing about some design decisions around the internet was quite interesting.
