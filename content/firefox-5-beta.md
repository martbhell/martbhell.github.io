Some cool stuff, but should you upgrade already? I ran the Firefox 4 beta for what feels like forever and didn't have any issues with it. It's nice to get updates whenever they are released, not have to wait for a long long time until the non-beta is out. I'll sure be upgrading to FF 5 on my home desktop.

It's now possible to run 'extremely beta' - alpha? Called Aurora. I'm gonna give it a shot :) It installs another Firefox and gives you a new icon (not the old fox around a blue globe). Plugins, bookmarks, passwords are saved/kept so that's cool. It's also noticeably faster than Firefox 4. Besides that it looks just the same. Maybe that'll change in the near future.
