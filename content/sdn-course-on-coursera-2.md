Halfway now, in week3, and just finished the first programming assignment in the course [Software Defined Networking](https://www.coursera.org/course/sdn "on coursera").

Quite happy with the course so far, the quizzes are not too hard if you actually listen to the video lectures and after taking Coursera's "[Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code](https://class.coursera.org/programming2-001/class/index)" the python code was not too much for me. It took me about day to get my head around it again (I don't write programs or scripts in python so often) and complete this first assignment where we got to create a custom topology with customized links.

I think it was a great first assignment as it got me used to playing with python again and also some of the features and what one can do with [mininet](http://mininet.org/ "http://mininet.org/").
