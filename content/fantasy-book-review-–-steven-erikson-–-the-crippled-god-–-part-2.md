## The Review

There's a lot more 'Books' in this one compared to the other one. I'm already at the fourth one. This also means that there is a lot more jumping between sub-stories in this book than all the other ones. It's really tangible this time: that there's this huge 'meeting' (ok I forgot the word used by Steven Erikson, it's a big one that starts with co-) of the forces. Some groups are mentioned maybe once per book, some are not mentioned at all but 'between' the lines in some of the other sub-stories' paths. As usual in the beginning of the Malaz books there is a lot of introspection - not so much action - but instead focus is on building the characters.

This is important but it's a slow and steady progress which always gets me a bit bored. But then again, a whole book of just action takes the fun out of it, especially with so many characters that it's hard to keep them separated. I need to have some kind of connection with a character before the action gets interesting. I mean in the end it boils down to some sword/magic fights right? And in earnest just a lot of that sword-hacking [is just not for me](http://www.guldmyr.com/blog/book-review-the-hunters-trilogy-by-r-a-salvatore/ "like in the book by salvatore").

Another thing I enjoy is that it's not about the same guys in each book! OK, there are some guys that keep on coming back and take quite a central role in the story line(s) - but the actual story is not primarily done through introspection/thoughts by the same characters. This gives the reader the opportunity to get to know some of the other people, surrounding the Bridgeburners & Bonehunters..  they've been in basically all books so really - you don't want another 1000 pages about the **same** Bridgeburner - it's just fine with a chapter or snippet here and there - to keep the intrigue up. Also I think there's a plausible maximum amount of thinking a character can do - or maybe there are these kind of people out there but I guess you never know - this is what's good with books I guess :)

There's an abundance of 'good' guys in this book. I mean the only really bad folks aren't really bad (if you discount gods then), they just have a not-so-nice plan to scour the planet of humans. There are evidence/happenings earlier in the series where humans have caught gods unawares (Feather Witch's stealing of the eye for example) and had  them suffering.

## The Kindle

As how's it going with the Kindle I must say I really enjoy it, except when doing a review like this. It's just not even close to as handy to jump back a random amount of pages to see what went on there - as it is in a book. But the Kindle wins when it comes to reading while you're doing other stuff  -  like at lunch - then it's very handy to just put it on the table and keep on eating and reading at the same time. Just a brief pause every now and then to click to the next page.
