I'm currently preparing for yet another accreditation, the previous one I took was the [BADCS](http://www.guldmyr.com/blog/brocade-accredited-data-center-specialist-badcs/ "Brocade Accredited Data Center Specialist – BADCS"),

The BASP (Brocade Accredited Server Specialist) appear to focus on the server side. Things like:

- how to install drivers
- HBA management tools
- describe features
- how to run diagnostics

This accrediation has the most questions of all the current ones, but it has the same amount of time allotted (one hour) so this exam will have a lot less time available for each question.

The curriculum for this accreditation are also free, they are called Introduction to HBA and Introduction to CNA. There's also some docs about the 1860 Fibre Adapter. They can be found on Brocade's Saba/training website under [my.brocade.com](http://my.brocade.com "my.brocade.com").

 

// Update 20140422: This accrediation has been replaced with something else. See the current list here: http://www.brocade.com/education/certification-accreditation/index.page?
